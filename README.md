Generator for all number combinations of base n, whose digits are unique

## Usage Example (Chess) ##

Number combinations generated by this software can be used to determine x/y positions of rooks on a Chess board assuming that no rook is able to take another rook. As a consequence, there must only be one rook per row and per column on the board.

![Chess Board 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8](http://i.imgur.com/m18qPQy.png)

This is the most basic example, which shows the positioning for the number combination **1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8**. 

![Chess Board 7-4-5-1-3-8-6-2](http://i.imgur.com/w0oMxm0.png)

This combination is more complicated than the first example, this uses the combination **7-4-5-1-3-8-6-2**. From top to bottom ("row-wise") the rooks are at the column positions 7, 4, 5, 1, 3, 8, 6 and 2.

Due to the special combination there's no rook that is able to take another rook.

The full list of these combinations is available at [output/base_8.txt](output/base_8.txt)

This is a very improbable use case, but it's still able to show the character of the number combinations generated by this software.

## Some Maths ##

The number of combination for a base 
*n* is equal to the faculty of *n*. In the class 
[CustomNumberSystem](src/de/jwiegratz/unique_numbers/CustomNumberSystem.java) you'll find the method **faculty(int n)**, which you can use to predetermine the size of the result set.
